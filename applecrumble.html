    <p>A family favorite, this apple crumble was originally my grandmother Hazel's recipe which my mom made on a regular basis. 
        She would make two at a time to take to sick or shut-in friends, or to potlucks. 
        There is never any left. Serve warm with French vanilla yogurt.</p>

    <p><strong>Ingredients to make:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>7 large Cortland apples-peeled, cored, and sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/3 cup unsalted butter, cubed</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>The steps to make the recipe:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Spread apples in an even layer in a deep dish pie plate or 8-inch square glass casserole dish. 
            Cover with white sugar, then top with cinnamon.</li>
        <li>Combine flour and brown sugar for topping in a bowl. Add butter and cut in with a pastry blender. 
            Spread topping evenly over apple mixture and pat down.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until apple mixture is bubbling and topping is browned, about 55 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <em><p>Note:You will probably want to double this recipe for larger groups. 
        If you do, you should increase the butter and the brown sugar in the topping by a tablespoon each.
        Bake in a 9x12-inch casserole dish. </p></em>
