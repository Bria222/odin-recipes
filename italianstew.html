    <p>This hearty beef and vegetable stew that can be made in the slow-cooker is a family favorite.
        It is also the backbone for an excellent beef soup, if you actually find yourself with leftovers.</p>

    <p><strong>Ingredients to make:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 pounds lean top round, trimmed and cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>2 large sweet onions, diced</li>
        <li>2 cups large chunks of celery</li>
        <li>4 large carrots, peeled and cut into large rounds</li>
        <li>1 pound crimini mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 cups dry red wine</li>
        <li>4 large tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds red potatoes (such as Red Bliss), cut into 1-inch chunks</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried marjoram</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried sage</li>
        <li>1 quart beef stock</li>
        <li>2 cups tomato sauce</li>


    </ul>

    <p><strong>The steps to make the recipe:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook beef in batches in hot oil until browned
            completely, about 5 minutes per batch.
            Remove browned beef cubes to a plate lined with paper towels,
            keeping skillet over heat and retaining the beef drippings.</li>

        <li>Cook and stir onion, celery, and carrots in the retained beef drippings until just softened, 2 to 3 minutes.
            Stir mushrooms and garlic into the onion mixture.</li>

        <li>Pour red wine into the pan; bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the
            pan with a wooden spoon.
            Continue cooking the mixture until the wine evaporates, 7 to 10 minutes.
            Stir tomatoes into the mixture.</li>
        <li>Return beef to skillet with potatoes, basil, thyme, marjoram, and sage.
            Pour beef stock and tomato sauce over the mixture. Bring the liquid to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low and simmer until the beef is very tender and the sauce is thick, 4 to 6 hours.</li>
    </ol>
    <em>Note:To create a soup from this stew, chop up vegetables and beef pieces into much smaller pieces and add
        vegetable stock or water until it resembles a soup.
        Simmer briefly, but not too high as it will make the soup extremely cloudy.</em>
