This project is to build on practicing my basic HTML knowledge that I have learned while doing the Odin project. I will be building a basic recipe website that will have a main index page which will have a few links to a few recipes. Some inspiration for tasty treats!

**After completing this project, I have accomplished:**


* Properly seting up html files accordingly
* Linked html files together
* Inputed images with alternative text
* Created ordered and unordered lists for the steps and recipes
* Added in cooking notes by emphasizing them at bottom of the page
* Added a Home/main page button on recipes sites to go back to starting page
* used body and paragraph elements to describe what the recipe is all about
* Linked a CSS stylesheet to the HTML files
* Properly implemented various types of CSS selectors and inheritance, keeping in mind of specificity rules.
