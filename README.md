This project is to build on practicing my basic HTML knowledge that I have learned while doing the Odin project. I will be building a basic recipe website that will have a main index page which will have a few links to a few recipes. Some inspiration for tasty treats!

After completing this project, I have accomplished:

-Properly set up html file accordingly
-Link html files together
-Input images with alternative text
-Create ordered and unordered lists
